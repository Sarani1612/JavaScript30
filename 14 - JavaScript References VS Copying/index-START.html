    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // console log here will be 100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // console log will be 200 100. Updating 'age' does not affect 'age2'.

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // logging 'players' now, it will also have 'Lux' as the last name.
    // 'team' is not its own array but is referencing 'players'.
    // Arrays differ from strings, numbers and booleans here.
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // changing team2[3] to 'Lux' now, will not change anything in 'players'
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "Heee Haww";
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // now logging both 'person' and 'captain', they will both have 'number'

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    // we start with an empty object, then 'person' denotes what we want to fold into the object and the third argument folds in new properties/values

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
        name: 'wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
            twitter: '@wesbos',
            facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
        }
    };
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // updating anything in social, for example: dev.social.twitter = '@coolman' will also update in 'wes' and not only in 'dev'.
    // Object.assign() and goes 1 level deep
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    //this will work because it turns the object into a string and immediately back into an object. Updating anything in dev2 now
    // will only update in dev2.
